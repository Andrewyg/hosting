## 4. Quick response time, high quality support.

Support is most important part in hosting, whether you’re professor or beginner, FastComet got a short response time while high quality support which mean whenever you get into issue you can get help in short time. Also they’ve also said ***“Customers are always right.”*** You can ask any question, server configuration, platform choosing etc. You can ask multiple not-related question in one ticket (although not good habit), it's just an amazing environment to whether do development or just write blog.

## 5. Fast response time/Uses SSD disk

Response time is also very important when making website, your site won't even got a chance when your site doesn’t load under 2 seconds for new visitor. Also they use **SSD disk** for all the servers, which meant you'll get an extreme fast exprtience on serving websites!

FastComet got a mobile friendly control center which meant you can have live chat, send support ticket, and manage your website wherever you go, on computer, on laptop, and even on phone!

## 7. Daily backup

Backup, a zip file that can save your time, save your life. I’ve experience many time that I crashed my site by modifying codes while you don’t know what it meant, and daily backups save me, you can simply chose a date and restore data without extra costs!

## 8. Powered by cPanel

cPanel is world most popular hosting control platfor, it let you can easily control your files, SSL certificates, DNS records, backup/restore websites etc. You'll know how powerful it is and stuck with it once you touch it!

## 9. Softaculous (one-click installation) supported

For those beginners, you’ll know how important one-click installation is, you’ll never know how hard that is (for some applications) to modify configuration files and run command your self. FastComet do all those for you, **no extra cost** with just one click, or even customized app with one support ticket.

## 10. Ability to deploy own apps

For those developers, this is important. You can upload your own app, nodejs, php, etc. And start them by SSH (nodejs).
